- provides an `Ordinal` type representing ordinal numbers
- `Ordinal`s should be used for values which zero-indexed or one-indexed cardinal numbers could be ambiguous
- `Ordinal`s are distinct from cardinal `Int`s
- conversions between `Ordinal`s and `Int`s may be made only by specifying zero- or one-indexing
- introduces a distinct namespace for the first ten ordinals
